# Overview

I developed a JavaScript based card matching game as an exercise to deepen my understanding of JavaScript and other
related web development technologies, with a focus on interactive design. This game challenges players to find matching
pairs of cards, in a typical game of memory. Performance metrics, including the time taken in seconds and the number of
attempts made, are kept track of and displayed once the game end conditions are met (all cards are matched).

# Development Environment

To develop this game, I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The core game logic was implemented using
JavaScript, while the HTML and CSS were used to structure and style the game's interface. I did not rely on external
libraries, focusing instead on vanilla JavaScript to exercise my use of the fundamentals.

I developed this game in the Jet Brains WebStorm IDE.

# Useful Websites

Here are some of the websites that I used during the development of this project:

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Mozilla Development Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)

# Future Work

Some of the things I would like to improve on with this project in the future include:

- Hiding the cared symbol so it cannot be seen when inspected
- A card that reshuffles the board, and is removed after being flipped
- A hint system, giving the player an indication of 2 different cards that could be a match to the current card
